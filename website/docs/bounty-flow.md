## What is a Bounty

Bounty is a funding task, OpenSquare is a platform for the Funders to publish funding tasks, and for the Hunters to get tasks done and earn money.

## Bounty flow

### 1. Creating Bounty

The whole process starts from Bounty creation. To create a Bounty, you need an account with sufficient funds for the operation. Please sign in with `Funder` account that we created during preparation phase.

Now, letâ€™s create a Bounty! At home page, click `New Bounty` to enter `Fund Bounty` page, and then fill the task title, the task payment amount, and the detail description. At last, click button `Fund Bounty `to submit data and apply for posting.

You may need to wait a few seconds for the data to be written into block-chain. Once successful, it will automatically redirect to the Bounty details you just created. Then you can preview and check about it.

### 2. Accept or Reject a Bounty

The bounty will not take effect immediately after it is created, it must be checked and accepted by the Councilors.

To check the Bounty, please switch to the `Councilor` account that we imported during the preparation phase.

If your current signed in account is a Councilor, you can find a menu item `Councilor` at  the top next to `Home`. Click on it to enter the Councilor page, then we can see a list of pending Bounties waiting for our operation. Find and click on the Bounty item we just created to check the detail, now you are able to `Accept` or `Reject` it. Because we want to experience the following process, please select `Accept`.

### 3. Hunter find and apply for a Bounty

Please switch to the `Hunter` account. Visit the app homepage, you can see a list of the approved bounties. Find and click on the one we created, and then check its details. Next, click the `Hunt` button to apply for the task.

If the operation is successful, you will find that your applicant listed at the bottom of the page. At this time, the hunter can't do anything, but just to wait for the task assignment.

### 4. Assigning Bounty to Hunter

When someone applies for the Bounty job, funder can start deciding who to give the task to. He usually refers to hunter's general score to make a decision. Because the score represents whether the hunter's previous works has performed well. So, now let us assign the Bounty.

Please switch to the `Funder` account and click on the account name in the upper right corner, then we enter the its profile page. We can find the current user's related bounties here. There are 5 tabs on this page, the two on the left are for funders.

* Applying Bounties - Pending bounties created by current user
* Fund Bounties -- Approved Bounties created by current user

Because the Bounty we created has just been approved, so you should find it under the `Fund Bounties` tab. Then, click on it to enter its details page.

In the details page, you can view who has applied for the task. Currently we have only one hunter applying. Click the `Assign to Hunter` button and select this hunter and confirm the assignment.

### 5. Hunter submitting the result

Similarly, hunter can also find the related bounty tasks on his profile. Below are the two tabs prepared for the hunters.

* Applying Bounties - The bounties the user is applying for
* Ongoing Bounties - The bounties the user is working on

On the `Ongoing Bounties` tab, we can found that there is a task waiting for us to complete, because current user has just been selected as the executor. Click it to enter the details page, you can view the task description again. Now it is time to use your talents and professional skills to accomplish this task brilliantly. After the work is completed, click the `Submit` button to submit the result to the funder.
