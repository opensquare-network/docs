## Bounty flow

### 1. Creating Bounty

The whole process starts from Bounty creation. To create a Bounty, you need an account with sufficient funds for the operation. Please sign in with `Funder` account that we created during preparation phase.

Now, letâ€™s create a Bounty! At home page, click `New Bounty` to enter `Fund Bounty` page, and then fill the task title, the task payment amount, and the detail description. At last, click button `Fund Bounty `to submit data and apply for posting.

You may need to wait a few seconds for the data to be written into block-chain. Once successful, it will automatically redirect to the Bounty details you just created. Then you can preview and check about it.

### 2. Accept or Reject a Bounty

The bounty will not take effect immediately after it is created, it must be checked and accepted by the Councilors.

To check the Bounty, please switch to the `Councilor` account that we imported during the preparation phase.

If your current signed in account is a Councilor, you can find a menu item `Councilor` at  the top next to `Home`. Click on it to enter the Councilor page, then we can see a list of pending Bounties waiting for our operation. Find and click on the Bounty item we just created to check the detail, now you are able to `Accept` or `Reject` it. Because we want to experience the following process, please select `Accept`.

### 3. Hunter find and apply for a Bounty

Please switch to the `Hunter` account. Visit the app homepage, you can see a list of the approved bounties. Find and click on the one we created, and then check its details. Next, click the `Hunt` button to apply for the task.

If the operation is successful, you will find that your applicant listed at the bottom of the page. At this time, the hunter can't do anything, but just to wait for the task assignment.
